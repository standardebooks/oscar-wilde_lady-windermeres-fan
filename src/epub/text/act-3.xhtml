If he cared for me, he would have come after me, would have taken me back by force. But he doesn’t care. He’s entrammelled by this woman⁠—fascinated by her⁠—dominated by her. If a woman wants to hold a man, she has merely to appeal to what is worst in him. We make gods of men and they leave us. Others make brutes of them and they fawn and are faithful. How hideous life is!⁠ ⁠… Oh! it was mad of me to come here, horribly mad. And yet, which is the worst, I wonder, to be at the mercy of a man who loves one, or the wife of a man who in one’s own house dishonours one? What woman knows? What woman in the whole world? But will he love me always, this man to whom I am giving my life? What do I bring him? Lips that have lost the note of joy, eyes that are blinded by tears, chill hands and icy heart. I bring him nothing. I must go back⁠—no; I can’t go back, my letter has put me in their power⁠—Arthur would not take me back! That fatal letter! No! Lord Darlington leaves England tomorrow.
