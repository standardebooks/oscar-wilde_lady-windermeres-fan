My dear nieces⁠—you know the Saville girls, don’t you?⁠—such nice domestic creatures⁠—plain, dreadfully plain, but so good⁠—well, they’re always at the window doing fancy work, and making ugly things for the poor, which I think so useful of them in these dreadful socialistic days, and this terrible woman has taken a house in Curzon Street, right opposite them⁠—such a respectable street, too! I don’t know what we’re coming to! And they tell me that Windermere goes there four and five times a week⁠—they <em>see</em> him. They can’t help it⁠—and although they never talk scandal, they⁠—well, of course⁠—they remark on it to everyone. And the worst of it all is that I have been told that this woman has got a great deal of money out of somebody, for it seems that she came to London six months ago without anything at all to speak of, and now she has this charming house in Mayfair, drives her ponies in the Park every afternoon and all⁠—well, all⁠—since she has known poor dear Windermere.</td>
